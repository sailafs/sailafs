Bridging the gap between psychology and data science to drive positive change. With a Master's in Health Psychology from the University of Stirling, I have honed expertise in quantitative/qualitative research methods, data analysis, and understanding human behavior. My thesis on post-traumatic growth in cancer survivors equipped me with strong analytical skills and insights into the mind-body connection.

Complementing my psychology background, I am expanding to a Data Science field, gaining proficiency in SQL, Python, and machine learning techniques through bootcamp at Rakamin Academy. I'm passionate about leveraging data to inform evidence-based strategies that improve health outcomes and overall well-being. My unique interdisciplinary perspective allows me to combine technical expertise with a nuanced grasp of human motivations.

Throughout internships in digital healthcare and career development, I have demonstrated the ability to analyze complex datasets, automate reporting workflows, and effectively communicate insights to stakeholders. I thrive in collaborative environments, actively seeking opportunities to apply my multidisciplinary skills in driving meaningful, data-driven solutions that prioritize human-centric approaches.
